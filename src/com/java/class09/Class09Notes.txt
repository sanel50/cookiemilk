Increment / Decrement Operator (++ , --) ; it will increment or decrement the value of variables by 1

            ++ :    Increment value of variables by 1
            -- :    Decrement value of variables by 1


Postfix Operator
            exp++;
                    *  operators comes after the variables
                    *  first complete all others operations and then increment the value of variables

Prefix Operator
            ++exp;
                    *  operators comes before the variables
                    *  first increment the value of variables and then complete all others operations
                                if we have ++exp first we will count this and the other will not be counted
